Lovers can take a romantic walk with a picture-perfect view. Health buffs can have outdoor yoga sessions at the lower boardwalk. And everyone can sit at the bayfront and enjoy sunset. Free outdoor performances are also regularly held at the waterfront. Wonder Full is considered as the largest light and water show in Southeast Asia. This free nightly spectacle features a delightful show of laser lights and water projections, accompanied by orchestra music. It is best viewed from the Event Plaza, which also holds concerts and other performances. The Helix Bridge connects Marina Centre to Marina South that is home to Gardens By The Bay.

       "text":"In Singapore, bumboat refers to a small boat or water taxi that is used for quick transport and river tours. These bumboats are often painted with eyes and faces supposedly to “see the danger ahead.” There are two bumboat service companies in Singapore – Singapore River Cruise and Singapore River Explorer. They follow a similar route with stops at the Esplanade, Boat Quay, Clarke Quay, Clemenceau, and Robertson Quay. A one-stop trip costs SG$3.00 (US$2.20). 40-minute river tours are also offered at SG$25.00 (US$18.00) per passenger. A bumboat ride down Singapore River is the cheapest and fastest way to see the stunning sights of downtown Singapore. You can relax at the boat deck and enjoy the breeze as the boat chugs along the river. Go in the late afternoon to catch the sunset and get the best of day and night views of the waterfront. A nighttime bumboat trip is a great chance to enjoy the light show at Marina Bay from a different yet amazing angle. The Merlion is undoubtedly the most identifiable representation of Singapore. Built by a local sculptor, Lim Nang Seng, this 8.6-metre statue sits at one end of the Marina Bay waterfront. Marina Bay Sands is an iconic resort complex located at the Bayfront. The landmark consists of three towers connected at the top by a 1-hectare roof terrace. Don’t forget to take a selfie on the bumboat with MBS at the background! The statue of Sir Stamford Raffles stands at the Raffles Landing Site near the Boat Quay. Sir Raffles was the founder of modern day Singapore. The statue is a reminder of Singapore’s olden days and the single point in history that changed the destiny of this Lion country.",

       "text":"Jurong Bird Park is the first wildlife park in Singapore and the biggest of its kind in Asia. It spreads across 20 hectares of verdant greenery on Jurong Hill and is home to more than 5,000 birds. The bird sanctuary opened its doors in 1971 and is managed by Wildlife Reserves Singapore. Jurong Bird Park offers the rare opportunity to interact with 400 species of birds in a park that is closest to their natural habitat. Walk into Waterfall Aviary, the park’s biggest free flight aviary, that shelters 600 birds and features a 30-metre waterfall. Visit the Asian birds at Wings of Asia. This zone has 500 birds including endangered species like the black-winged starling, the Bali Mynah, and the Luzon bleeding-heart dove. Feed lories at the 9-storey Lory Loft! The loft is designed to reflect the vibe of the Australian outback. Walk across suspended bridges as you go around feeding birds at the aviary. Be transported to Antarctica through the Penguin Coast! Watch adorable penguins swim in the water and waddle on ice at the indoor, climate-controlled zone. Explore other attractions and learn more about breeding and conservation at the research center.",
