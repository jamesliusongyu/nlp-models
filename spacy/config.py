        "Singapore is a tiny island nation in Southeast Asia that’s become one of the world’s most prosperous countries. Walk around for a day and you’ll see all the features of an ultramodern society with its impressive skyline, contemporary architecture, high-end shopping malls, and highly efficient subway system. But in spite of its facade of steel and glass, Singapore retains much of the ethnic and cultural diversity that earned it its nickname – “the melting pot of Asia”. Iconic structures like Marina Bay Sands and Supertree Grove are impressive but equally of note are the ethnic pockets within the city that preserve each culture’s unique heritage and traditions. Hop on a City Sightseeing Bus and you’ll be treated to colorful neighborhoods like Little India, Chinatown, Arab Street, and Kampong Glam, all within the span of half an hour. This balance of modernity and cultural preservation is what makes Singapore so fascinating. Another thing I found surprising about Singapore is that it’s apparently the second most densely populated country in the world, behind only Monaco. It certainly doesn’t feel crowded when you’re there, perhaps due to the efforts they’ve made into making it a pleasant and liveable green city. In spite of being a city-state with 100% of its population urbanized, over 50% of Singapore’s area is covered by greenery. It boasts over 50 major parks and 4 nature reserves, all within a 720 sq km area. If there existed a utopic city in the world today, then that city would be Singapore."
